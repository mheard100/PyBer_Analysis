Ride share app visual analysis
## Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer Analysis
### The analysis should contain the following:

1. **Overview of the analysis** 
* Explain the purpose of the new analysis:

    > The purpose of this report as a Data Analyst for PyBer is to create a complete summary of the Ride-Sharing data by city type. Including a quick summary of line, bar, scatter, bubble, pie, and box-and-whisker plots using Matplotlib libraries while determining mean, median, and mode using Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy statistics. Our Final Analysis includes a multiple-line graphs of total weekly fares for each city type.


2. **Results** 
* Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types:

    > * Suburban fares started around $1,000 with a spike in mid-late February.   
    > * Rural fares started at around $200, the analysis shows fares fluctuate with an increase in April.  
    > * Urban fares start with an average of $1,800 in January with a high around $2500 just before and after the start of March.

3. **Summary** 
* Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:

    > **1)** PyBer should consider expanding business to rural and suburban cities. With higher fares per ride, there is opportunity to make good profit.There are less drivers in rural and suburban areas, so hiring more drivers can lead to more profits. 

    
    > **2)** The Urban cities fare is the highest and consistent, meaning it should remain a priority.   

    
    > **3)** Since we know when fares dip based on time of the year, PyBer can change prices to reach financial goals based on demand.
